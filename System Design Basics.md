## Functional vs Non-functional requirements.

Functional requirement:
It is what it must do, what we build and what features it must have.

Non Functional requirement:
It is how we serve it to the user. 

Factors to consider in Non Functional requirement:
- Latency.
- Throughput. 
- Availability.
- Reliability.
- Consistency. 
- Scalability.
- Maintainability.



* **Latency, Throughput, Availability, Reliability, Consistency, Scalability, Maintainability.**
* **CAP Theorem (Consistency, Availability, Partition Tolerance).**
* **Trade-offs: Speed vs Consistency, Cost vs Scalability
